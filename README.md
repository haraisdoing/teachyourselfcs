|Computer Architecture|If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.|[컴퓨터구조](http://www.kocw.net/home/cview.do?cid=5139e65e54154a76) (숭실대학교 김병기교수)|
|Algorithms and Data Structures|If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems.|알고리즘 () 자료구조 ()|
|Math for CS|CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.|이산수학 () 선형대수 ()|
|Operating Systems|Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.|[운영체제](http://www.kocw.net/home/cview.do?cid=4b9cd4c7178db077) (이화여자대학교 반효경교수)|
