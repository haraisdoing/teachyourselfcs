|Subject|Why study?|Videos|
|-------|----------|------|
|Programming|Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion.|[Principles of Programming](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~kwang/4190.210/mooc/) (서울대학교 이광근교수)
|Computer Architecture|If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.|[컴퓨터구조](http://www.kocw.net/home/cview.do?cid=5139e65e54154a76) (숭실대학교 김병기교수)|
|Algorithms and Data Structures|If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems.|[자료구조](http://www.kocw.net/home/cview.do?cid=c83b4c0d3b986a6e) (이화여자대학교 이상호교수) 알고리즘 ()|
|Math for CS|CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.|이산수학 () 선형대수 ()|
|Operating Systems|Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.|[운영체제](http://www.kocw.net/home/cview.do?cid=4b9cd4c7178db077) (이화여자대학교 반효경교수)|
|Computer Networking|The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.|컴퓨터네트워크 ()|
|Databases|Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.|데이터베이스 ()|
|Languages and Compilers|If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.||
|Distributed Systems|These days, *most* systems are distributed systems.|분산시스템 ()|
